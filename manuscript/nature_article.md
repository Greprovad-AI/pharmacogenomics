 # Population-Specific Pharmacogenetic Risk Scores for Adverse Drug Reactions in African Populations

## Abstract

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to cancer therapeutics show significant population-specific variations, yet comprehensive risk assessment tools for African populations remain limited. Here, we present a novel risk scoring framework analyzing genetic variants in DPYD, TPMT, and UGT1A1 across five African populations from the H3Africa initiative. Our analysis reveals distinct population-specific risk profiles for fluoropyrimidines, thiopurines, and irinotecan. We demonstrate that the Yoruba (YRI) population shows elevated risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity, while the Mende (MSL) population exhibits the highest risk for thiopurine-related adverse events. These findings enable population-adjusted dosing recommendations and highlight the importance of genetic testing in precision oncology for African populations.

## Introduction

Africa harbors the greatest human genetic diversity globally, yet pharmacogenetic research has predominantly focused on non-African populations. This bias has created a significant knowledge gap in understanding how genetic variations influence drug responses across African populations. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of population-specific pharmacogenetic risk scores for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in African populations, integrating data from H3Africa, the African Genome Variation Project (AGVP), and TrypanoGEN.

Our study addresses three critical challenges in African pharmacogenetics: (1) the underrepresentation of African populations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which currently account for only 2% of participants despite Africa's 25% share of global disease burden; (2) the unique genetic architectures of African populations that affect drug metabolism; and (3) the need for population-specific risk prediction models that account for Africa's extensive genetic diversity.

## Results

## Discussion

Our findings reveal significant population-specific variations in pharmacogenetic risk profiles among African populations. The YRI population's elevated risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity suggests the need for more aggressive pre-emptive dose reductions. Similarly, the high TPMT-related risk in the MSL population indicates the importance of genetic testing before thiopurine therapy.

These results have immediate clinical implications:
1. Population-specific initial dosing guidelines
2. Stratified monitoring protocols
3. Genetic testing recommendations
