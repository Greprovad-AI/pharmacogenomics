## Figure 1: Population-Specific Genetic Risk Scores
Heatmap showing the distribution of genetic risk scores across five African populations (LWK, YRI, MSL, GWD, ESN) for three key pharmacogenes (DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1). Risk scores are calculated using weighted combinations of clinically significant variants. Color intensity corresponds to risk level, with darker red indicating higher risk. Values in each cell represent the calculated risk score.

## Figure 2: Drug-Specific Risk Scores by Population
Grouped bar plot comparing population-specific risk scores for major cancer therapeutics (5-FU, Capecitabine, Thiopurines, and Irinotecan). Each cluster represents a population, with bars showing risk scores for different drugs. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals calculated through bootstrap resampling (n=1000).

## Figure 3: Risk Score Distributions by Gene and Population
Violin plots depicting the distribution of risk scores across populations for each pharmacogene. The width of each violin represents the density of data points at that risk level. Black dots indicate median values, while the internal box plots show quartiles. This visualization highlights both the central tendency and variability of risk scores within each population-gene combination.

## Figure 4: Manhattan Plot of Pharmacogenetic Variants
Manhattan plot showing genome-wide association results for pharmacogenetic variants. The x-axis represents chromosomal position, and the y-axis shows the -log₁₀ transformed p-values. Red dashed line indicates genome-wide significance threshold (p = 5 × 10⁻⁸). Key variants in DPYD (Chr 1), UGT1A1 (Chr 2), and TPMT (Chr 6) are labeled. Point colors distinguish different chromosomes, and significant variants are annotated with their rs IDs. This visualization highlights the strongest genetic associations with adverse drug reactions across the genome.

## Figure 5: VIP Variant Frequencies Across African Populations
Bar plot showing the distribution of key pharmacogenetic variant frequencies (DPYD*2A, TPMT*2, UGT1A1*28) across 13 African populations from three major genomic datasets (H3Africa, AGVP, TrypanoGEN). Populations are grouped by dataset and separated by vertical dashed lines. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. This figure demonstrates the substantial variation in risk allele frequencies across different African regions and populations.

## Figure 6: Drug Risk Score Distribution Across Datasets
Violin plots comparing the distribution of drug risk scores for three cancer therapeutics (5-FU, Capecitabine, Irinotecan) across the three datasets. The width of each violin represents the density of observations at that risk score level. Box plots within the violins show the median and interquartile ranges. This visualization highlights dataset-specific and drug-specific variations in predicted risk scores.

## Figure 7: Pan-African Population Structure Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot showing the genetic relationships among all studied populations. Points represent individual samples, colored by population and shaped by dataset (H3Africa: circles, AGVP: squares, TrypanoGEN: triangles). The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) capture the major axes of genetic variation. This figure illustrates the genetic structure of African populations and its relationship to pharmacogenetic variation.

## Extended Data Figure 1: Risk Score Validation
(Available in Supplementary Information)
Scatter plots showing the correlation between predicted risk scores and observed adverse event rates in clinical validation cohorts. Each point represents a patient, with color coding indicating population origin. Diagonal line represents perfect prediction, while shaded area shows 95% confidence interval.

Flowchart illustrating the recommended clinical decision-making process based on population-specific risk scores. Includes decision thresholds, recommended actions, and monitoring protocols for each risk category.
